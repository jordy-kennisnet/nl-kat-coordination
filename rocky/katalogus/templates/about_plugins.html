                            Plugins gather data, objects and insight. Each plugin has its own focus area
                            and strengths and may be able to work with other plugins to gain even more insights.

                            Each Normalizer searches for a specific object. You could run one to find all the phonenumbers within a document, as well as a Normalizer to find all the urlâ€™s.
